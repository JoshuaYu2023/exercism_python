1. The params in a defined function can be used as part of the return function. This way you can do math ( + - * / etc.) with an already defined number to get the results of the function.
2. similar to JS, if I were to define my params in the function itself, I could change the specified numbers wanted, instead of leaving it open-ended like in guidos lasagna.
3. True/false in python are boolean types and can be bound to a variable. They are evaluated using "and", "or", and "not".
